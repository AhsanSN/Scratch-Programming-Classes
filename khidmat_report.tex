\maketitle

This project is to teach programming concepts on Scrach using Drag-Drop programming to underpriviliged students at Fixit School.

Fixit School is a non-profit organization and an initiative by #FIXIT to provide free education to the underprivileged children of Pakistan. Students of all ages are taught fundamental subjects, such as English , Maths, Science, Urdu, Islamiat. 

Fixit School teaches its students the fundamental subjects of Science and Literature. It was felt that the students should be taught basic programming concepts on Scratch (Drag-Drop programming) that they can use in the lives ahead and progress in the field of Computer Science.

We will be teaching the students 2 hours daily on Fixit School's premises under the supervision of their Admission Manager. The goal is to teach them the basic programming concepts and make them capable of building their own games using drag-n-drop programming on Scratch.

\section*{Week 1: 14--18 May, 2018}

We spent this week teaching the students for-loops, and if-statements. Board games, two 'Hour of Code' and the EDVON software, were used to teach these concepts.

\section*{Conclusion}

Our project was to teach the students of Fixit School programming on Scratch. We started by teaching them concepts like loops and statements through on-board games and then moved to 'Hour of Code' sessions. After the students had done sufficient practice on it, we moved them to EDVON and familiarised them with its tools. At the end of the classes, students had learned to create their own games on EDVON/Scratch, and had already developed 10+ games, including a multiplayer game.
